## What has GitHub Pages ever done for us?

To answer Reg's question* from the index page: There are several factors that go into considering whether or not to use GitHub and GitHub Pages for a project. It is a wonderul tool to have available freely and should certainly be used when collaboration between large groups of individuals is required or when documents are shared among many people and it is more efficient to store them on a service that isn't Dropbox.

## Some positives of using GitHub
GitHub Pages is a powerful tool that allows files to be stored in a public repository online, with hosting by GitHub. This is especially useful when one desires to keep track of lots of code.

## Some negatives of using GitHub
Unfortunately, Github is not particularly useful for storing data especially that which is confidential. For example, in the case of health sciences data where there are often substantial restraints on the sharing/publication of data, it would not be wise to upload data with specific identifiers that could e.g. be traced back to an individual. 

Another possible problem is that of intellectual property protection: Code stored in a public repository is _public_ which means anyone can have a copy. Fine if your goal is to disseminate your code, not fine if it isn't.
